Dapper Dasher Game:

new for me in this course was...
 *  Working in functions that return data structures in C++
 *  Range based for loops in C++
 *  Loading and Unloading Textures with raylib
 *  Collision detection using raylibs built in function CheckCollisionRecs()


Things that could be improved or added...
 *  Restart game
 *  Start game
 *  Score

For this code to compile on windows without changes, raylib needs to be installed to C:\raylib
Get raylib from https://www.raylib.com/
